# SQL Murder Mystery Challenge
A fun challenge using SQL to solve a made up  murder mystery crime scene. This was a fun way to practice using SQL to get to the bottom of the case using a variety of querying methods. I highly recommend this to anyone learning SQL or just looking for a challenge!

## Try it yourself

### Contents
- `queries.sql`: scratch work that I used to get the information I needed at every step, each unveiling more 'truth' to the story.
- I filtered out the name of the culprit at the end so NO SPOILERS here. 
- I'd recommend giving the challenge a try before scrolling to the bottom of `queries.sql`
